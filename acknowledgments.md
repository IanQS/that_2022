I found
the [Haskell Wiki about Monads](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad) (and the wiki overall) to be enlightening. However, for
someone
without a background in category theory, I found it to be difficult to understand until I had spent some time sitting on
the material (even then, I know that there is a lot of information that I am missing).

From an applied standpoint, I
found [The Absolute Best Intro to Monads For Software Engineers by Studying with Alex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2w45qRc3aU)
to be invaluable. It covers `monads` in a way that feels very accessible for the average SWE.

Finally, I recommend reading
through [Functors, Applicatives, And Monads In Pictures from adit.io](https://adit.io/posts/2013-04-17-functors,_applicatives,_and_monads_in_pictures.html),
which I found to be useful (albeit a bit simple).
