## Intuition

A functor can be thought of as a box. This box wraps some underlying values and we must define a way to map a function
over the contents of the structure; thus affecting the contents of the box.

## Class Declaration

An intuition.

### Haskell Class Declaration

```haskell
class Functor Func where
    fmap :: (T1 -> T2) -> Func T1 -> Func T2
    (<$) :: T1 -> Func T2 -> Func T1
```

- The first line describes a function declaration whereby we take a function and a functor (boxing some type, `a`).

- The second line describes how we can take an initial value and replace values in the `Func T2` with values of
  type `T1`

#### Disclaimer

**Note** We modified the types and the functor definition.

- We modified the types to be more in line with a templated type (as you might see in typed languages)
- We modify the functor definition to make it more clear that we are wrapping the underlying types. The original functor
  name was `f` which, for most programmers, evokes thoughts of calling a function on a type `T1`

## Laws and Properties

### Implementation Requirements

As mentioned in the [README.md](README.md),

> A functor must support, [at the minimum, according to Haskell, ](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functor#Syntax), a `fmap`,
> which describes applying an arbitrary function into the data encapsulated in our class.

### Laws:

[Lookin at the Haskell documentation once again](https://wiki.haskell.org/Functor#Functor_Laws), to be a functor, two
laws must be satisfied:

```
1) identity transformations must be preserved
2) fmap (f . g)  ==  fmap f . fmap g (composition must be respected)
```

## Examples

### Over a list

As we can see, the  `fmap` for a list is basically the `map`

```python
from typing import Callable, List, TypeVar

T1 = TypeVar("T1")
T2 = TypeVar("T2")


def our_list_map(
        incoming_list: List[T1],
        func: Callable[[T1], T2]
):
    return [func(el) for el in incoming_list]
# OR map(func, incoming_list)
```

### A Binary Search Tree

And here we use a binary-search-tree

```python

from typing import Callable, TypeVar

T1 = TypeVar("T1")
T2 = TypeVar("T2")


class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self):
        ...

    @staticmethod
    def fmap(
            func_to_apply: Callable[[T1], T2],
            bst_instance: "BinarySearchTree"
    ):
        horizon = [bst_instance.root]
        while horizon:
            curr_node = horizon.pop()
            if curr_node:
                curr_node.data = func_to_apply(curr_node.data)
                horizon.append(curr_node.left)
                horizon.append(curr_node.right)
        return bst_instance
```

### A Custom Class

However, the benefit of a functor is rather limited if all we can do is apply it
to built-in types. So, consider the following simple example:

```python
from typing import Callable, List, TypeVar

T1 = TypeVar("T1")
T2 = TypeVar("T2")


class SomeCls():
    def __init__(self):
        self.d1 = "d1"
        self.d2 = "d2"
        self.c1 = "c1"
        self.c2 = "c2"

    @staticmethod
    def fmap_d(
            func_to_apply: Callable[[T1], T2],
            instance_of_SomeCls: "SomeCls"
    ):
        instance_of_SomeCls.d1 = func_to_apply(instance_of_SomeCls.d1)
        instance_of_SomeCls.d2 = func_to_apply(instance_of_SomeCls.d2)
        return instance_of_SomeCls

    @staticmethod
    def fmap_c(
            func_to_apply: Callable[[T1, T1], T2],
            instance_of_SomeCls: "SomeCls"
    ):
        """
        Calls our func_to_apply on (c1, c2) and alters c1
        """
        instance_of_SomeCls.c1 = func_to_apply(
            instance_of_SomeCls.c1,
        )
        return instance_of_SomeCls
```

See here how we provide two `fmap` definitions? Over the `d`s and the `c`s? 

**Note** If you look online, you'll see the python examples break down a little. This is because
Python's type system isn't as well built for dynamic dispatch. Consider the following from [Andrew Jarombek's Haskell Part VI: Functors
](https://jarombek.com/blog/may-28-2019-haskell-pt6):

```haskell
data Distance a = Miles a | Kilometers a | Meters a
                  deriving (Show, Read)
                  
instance Functor Distance where
  -- fmap :: (a -> b) -> Distance a -> Distance b
  fmap f (Miles x) = Miles (f x)
  fmap f (Kilometers x) = Kilometers (f x)
  fmap f (Meters x) = Meters (f x)
```

Notice how, depending on the "type" of distance, we can apply the `fmap` differently?

## Closing Out

And that's the power of a functor - it lets us abstract over containers of things. They let us "swap" out the
underlying "backend" (data structure) while still preserving a similar interface, as well as allowing our end user to
ignore the underlying implementation details.

As long as our end-user uses code that "obeys"
our requirements (function signatures), they do not need to care about how we do things in the background. For example,
see how in `sol/functor_day_1.py`, our implementation was "hardcoded" to a `List`? Not anymore!
